As modern software architectures become more distributed and data-intensive, developers increasingly need powerful query engines that don’t require separate database servers or complex infrastructure. This shift towards embedded analytics is particularly evident in edge computing scenarios, serverless architectures, and applications requiring real-time data processing capabilities.</p>\n<p>This trend is driven by several factors, including the need for reduced operational complexity, lower infrastructure costs, and the ability to process data closer to where it’s generated. In-process SQL engines provide a compelling solution by eliminating the need for separate database management while maintaining high performance. The combination of these factors has created fertile ground for innovations like chDB to flourish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-cases-for-chdb\">Use cases for chDB</h2>\n<p>chDB’s versatility makes it well-suited for several key use cases in modern data architectures. The project’s ability to handle large-scale data processing within the application process, combined with Clickhouse’s proven performance characteristics, opens up new possibilities for developers and data engineers. Let’s explore some of the most compelling use cases where chDB shines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"local-data-pipelines\">Local data pipelines</h3>\n<p>One of the primary use cases for chDB is building efficient local data pipelines. Its ability to process large datasets in-memory makes it ideal for ETL operations, data transformations, and preprocessing tasks that would traditionally require a full database setup. Developers can leverage chDB to perform complex SQL operations on local files, making it perfect for data scientists working with CSV files, JSON data, or Parquet formats. The seamless integration with popular programming languages like Python and Rust enables smooth workflow automation and rapid development of data processing scripts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/chdb-query.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"serverless-sql-analytics\">Serverless SQL Analytics</h3>\n<p>chDB has a variety of features that allow very efficient and direct querying of objects directly in-memory using features such as user-defined functions and almost 1:1 feature parity with Clickhouse.</p>\n<p>This makes it particularly well-suited for serverless computing environments where spinning up a full database instance would be impractical or cost-prohibitive. Developers can embed chDB directly into their Lambda functions or serverless applications to perform complex analytics on data stored in cloud storage services like S3.</p>\n<p>The ability to execute queries without maintaining persistent connections or managing database infrastructure significantly reduces operational overhead while maintaining high performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/chdb-udf.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"using-chdb-a-in-process-data-pipeline-demo\">Using chDB: A in-process Data Pipeline Demo</h2>\n<p>Let’s explore a practical example of using chDB to build an efficient data pipeline that processes and analyzes a large dataset locally. In this demonstration, we’ll use Python to load a CSV file containing customer transaction data, perform some aggregations, and export the results - all using chDB’s powerful in-memory engine. This example will showcase chDB’s performance advantages and ease of use compared to traditional approaches.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"python\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">import</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> chdb</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">import</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> pandas </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">as</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> pd</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\"># Initialize chDB with our dataset</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">db </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> chdb.session()</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">data </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> pd.read_csv(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">'transactions.csv'</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\"># Execute complex aggregation query</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">result </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> db.query(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"\"\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    SELECT </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        date_trunc('month', transaction_date) as month,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        sum(amount) as total_sales,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        count(distinct customer_id) as unique_customers</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    FROM data </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    GROUP BY month </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    ORDER BY month</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"\"\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"features-id-love-to-see-in-chdb\">Features I’d love to see in chDB</h2>\n<p>While chDB is pretty amazing where it’s at, there’s a few things I’d love to see support for over time.</p>\n<p>First, I’d love to see better support for materialized views and incremental aggregations.
