> In a landscape where data is the new oil, we wanted to build a tool that creates the refinery to extract value from data. - James

When we started Portcullis, we had a few goals in mind:

- **Build a data commerce portal that is easy to use and maintain.**
- **Build a data commerce portal that is so flexible it can be used for applications even outside data sharing.**
- **Provide users with a way to commercialize their data without having to commit a huge portion of their ACV to a data sharing platform.**

While Portcullis in many ways is a simple tool, the commercialization it enables and the flexibility it provides is what makes it so powerful. We also believe that the value compared to other alternatives is bar-none.
