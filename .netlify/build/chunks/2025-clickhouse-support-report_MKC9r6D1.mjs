Welcome to the first annual 2025 Enterprise Clickhouse Support Report! This report synthesizes post data from over 100 #help channel requests in the Clickhouse Slack workspace to provide actionable insights for the Clickhouse ecosystem. Our findings highlight both the tremendous growth potential and the critical areas where improved support infrastructure could accelerate adoption.

# Preamble

At Portcullis, we’re insanely passionate about identifying patterns and seeing processes that can be improved to help ecosystems develop and mature. That’s why we started this company in the first place after we noticed the impressive query speeds and rapid adoption of Clickhouse as a platform. 

That being said, for the ecosystem to develop further, there are some things we believe need to happen for greater mass adoption. In this report we’re going to lay out some of the statistics we’ve identified in the Clickhouse #help channel and why we believe improving both the community and enterprise support offerings, or at least the knowledge of them, can help take the Clickhouse ecosystem to new heights. 

## Our Analysis Methodology

Gathering this data was a tedious effort which required a lot of manual labor and careful review of hundreds of support requests across multiple Slack channels. We focused specifically on the #help channels in both the Clickhouse and Altinity Slack workspaces, analyzing posts from January through February 2025. Our methodology involved categorizing each support request by topic, urgency, and resolution status to identify key patterns and areas for improvement.

The exact data-points we gathered were:

- Profile Health (eg. Has a profile pic)
- Datetime Offset
- Company Response
- Community Response
- General Engagment
- Post Quality
- Status

Our findings brought us to an eventual conclusion that there are certain traits that get higher engagement.

## Our Findings

After analyzing over 100 support requests, we discovered several key patterns that significantly influence response rates and resolution times, as well as key data-points in the response metrics overall. 

### 1.  Only 32% of posts received input from Clickhouse staff

![chart.svg](/blog/chart.svg)

This relatively low engagement rate from official Clickhouse staff highlights a potential gap in support coverage. While the community often steps in to help, having more direct involvement from the Clickhouse team, or leveraging AI assistants like the one we are building at Portcullis, could significantly improve resolution times and user satisfaction. This finding suggests an opportunity for expanding the official support team or implementing a more structured response system.

### 2. 34% of posts went with no engagement

![chart(1).svg](/blog/chart(1).svg)

Posts that got unanswered represent a significant challenge for the Clickhouse community. Not only does it potentially discourage new users from seeking help, but it also indicates a possible gap in community support infrastructure. While some questions may be resolved through other channels, this statistic suggests a need for more robust community engagement strategies.

### 4. 66% of posters lacked a profile picture

![chart(2).svg](/blog/chart(2).svg)

This surprising statistic about profile pictures reveals an interesting correlation with engagement rates. Our analysis shows that posts from users with profile pictures received more responses than those without. This suggests that taking the simple step of adding a profile picture could significantly improve a user's chances of getting help in the community.

### 5. Heavy representation in +10 and +13 datetime offsets to PST

![chart(3).svg](/blog/chart(3).svg)

This geographic distribution of support requests, heavily concentrated in time zones +10 and +13 hours ahead of PST (corresponding to Asia-Pacific regions), highlights a potential mismatch between support availability and user needs. With many questions coming from these regions during their working hours, which often fall during off-hours for US-based support teams, there may be an opportunity to expand support coverage or establish regional support hubs to better serve these users.

## Potential Solutions

Based on our analysis, we propose several concrete solutions to address the identified support challenges:

- Implement a 24/7 Enterprise Support Program with dedicated regional teams to address the timezone coverage gaps
- Deploy AI-powered support assistants like we are building at Portcullis to provide immediate responses to common questions and triage more complex issues
- Create an incentive program for active community members to encourage more consistent engagement and higher quality responses

We live in an age where the tools and technology exist to provide comprehensive, around-the-clock support for global developer communities. The challenge now lies not in technical limitations, but in implementing the right combination of human expertise, community engagement, and AI assistance to create a sustainable support ecosystem. With proper investment in these areas, Clickhouse can dramatically improve its support infrastructure and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion

Based on our analysis of Clickhouse support patterns in early 2025, several clear opportunities for improvement emerge. The combination of low official staff engagement, significant unanswered posts, and timezone misalignment suggests a need for a more robust, globally-distributed support infrastructure. By addressing these gaps through expanded enterprise support options, improved community engagement tools, and strategic deployment of AI assistance, the Clickhouse ecosystem can better serve its growing user base and accelerate adoption worldwide.
