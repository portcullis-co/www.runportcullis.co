In 2023, the global mining market size is estimated to be valued at 1.1 trillion U.S. dollars according to <a href=\"https://www.globalmarketestimates.com/market-report/mining-market-3926\">Global Market Estimates</a>.</p>\n<p>As the world becomes more tech-driven, we rely more and more on rare earth metals to power our phones, appliances, and even lifesaving devices.

In this blog post, we’re going to explore what digital twins are, and how ClickHouse can be a powerful backbone to digital twin data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-the-heck-is-a-digital-twin\">What the heck is a digital twin?</h2>\n<p>A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, process, or system that exists in the real world. Think of it as a highly sophisticated digital mirror that reflects not just what something looks like, but how it behaves, performs, and changes over time. In the context of mining operations, digital twins can model everything from individual pieces of equipment like excavators and haul trucks to entire mining sites, complete with real-time data about operations, maintenance needs, and environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>These digital representations serve multiple purposes: they help predict equipment failures before they occur, optimize resource allocation, and ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations. By maintaining a real-time digital twin, mining operations can make data-driven decisions that improve efficiency while reducing risks and environmental impact.</p>\n<p>The challenge, however, lies in managing the massive amounts of data that power these digital twins. This is where ClickHouse enters the picture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-digital-twins-process-data\">How digital twins process data</h2>\n<p>Digital twins process data in a variety of ways, but one of the most commonly seen formats and methods is using messaging broker protocols such as MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and Apache Kafka. These messaging protocols enable real-time data streaming from sensors and equipment to the digital twin system, ensuring that the virtual representation stays synchronized with its physical counterpart. The data typically includes measurements like temperature, pressure, vibration, location, and operational status.</p>\n<p>The format this data renders in a data warehouse is known as time series data. This type of data is characterized by its timestamp-based nature and sequential ordering, making it ideal for tracking changes and patterns over time. In the context of digital twins, time series data allows for both real-time monitoring and historical analysis of equipment performance and operational metrics.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/time-series-chart.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-time-series-engine-experimental\">The Time Series Engine (Experimental)</h2>\n<p>ClickHouse has recently introduced an experimental Time Series Engine that’s particularly well-suited for handling the type of data generated by digital twins. This specialized engine is designed to efficiently store and process time-series data, making it an excellent choice for applications that require real-time monitoring and historical analysis. The engine optimizes storage and query performance by organizing data around timestamps, which is crucial for digital twin applications where temporal relationships between data points are paramount. Let’s look at some potential implementation in both Clickhouse and chDB.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-a-acme-mining-companys-clickhouse\">Example A. Acme Mining Company’s Clickhouse</h3>\n<p>To demonstrate how the ClickHouse Time Series Engine can be used for Acme Mining Company’s digital twin data, imagine we’re tracking the performance of a mining excavator in real time. The data includes metrics such as engine temperature, vibration levels, and fuel consumption, all of which are stored as time series data in a ClickHouse table.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of a query to analyze engine temperature trends over the last hour:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">SELECT</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    toStartOfMinute(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">timestamp</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">AS</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> minute</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">    avg</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(engine_temperature) </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">AS</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> avg_temp</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">FROM</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    excavator_metrics</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">WHERE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    timestamp</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> >=</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> now</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">() </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">-</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> INTERVAL </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> HOUR</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">GROUP BY</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    minute</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">ORDER BY</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    minute</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> ASC</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>This query groups the data by minute, calculates the average engine temperature for each minute, and orders the results chronologically.
