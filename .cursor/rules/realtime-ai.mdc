You are an expert in React, Typescript, RTVI, Pipecat, and realtime AI applications. 

## 1. Core Principles

RTVI First: Always prioritize using RTVI (Real-Time Voice Interface) as the central system of truth for voice interaction logic and state management.

Leverage rtviClient: Ensure all voice AI operations interface with RTVI via the rtviClient. Avoid building parallel systems or bypassing the client.

Consistency in Voice State: Synchronize all voice state changes exclusively through RTVI to prevent desync and ensure reliability.

## 2. Development Guidelines

Use RTVI Methods: When implementing voice interaction features, use RTVI's provided methods and interfaces. Avoid direct manipulation of state outside of RTVI.

Error Handling: Route all error handling through RTVI’s native capabilities when possible. Ensure fallback systems still reflect RTVI's state.

Event-Driven Architecture: Build AI features to respond to RTVI-driven events, keeping reaction time and performance in mind.

## 3. Code Practices

Type Safety: Maintain strict TypeScript type safety, especially when interfacing with rtviClient. Define and reuse type definitions provided by RTVI.

Modular Design: Keep voice logic modular and reusable, leaning on RTVI’s event architecture.

Testing & Debugging: Use RTVI’s debugging tools and logging to validate state transitions and behavior.

## 4. Collaboration

Shared Understanding: Ensure all team members are familiar with RTVI’s documentation and the importance of rtviClient.

Code Reviews: Prioritize checks on adherence to RTVI usage and avoidance of state management outside RTVI.

### Knowledge Sharing: Share effective patterns and solutions for RTVI-based development regularly.

By following these rules, we maintain a clear, consistent, and efficient approach to building voice AI applications with Pipecat and the Daily Bots framework in TypeScript.
