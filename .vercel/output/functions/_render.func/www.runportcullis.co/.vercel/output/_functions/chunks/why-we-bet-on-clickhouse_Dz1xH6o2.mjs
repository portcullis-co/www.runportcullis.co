When we first dove into it, the UI was nothing like it is today, and the continous improvement has been amazing to watch because their UI is superb. \n\nSo what went into our final decision to become so bullish on Clickhouse?\n\n## The Architecture\n\nClickhouse has a pretty great architectural layout which allows it to hit some pretty sleek metrics. On top of being a true column-oriented DBMS where no extra data is stored along with values, Clickhouse uses data compression to achieve excellent performance. \n\n### Storage Layer\n\nClickhouse's core feature-set is powered by a family of table engines called the **MergeTree** family. They provide most features for resilience and high-performance data retrieval: columnar storage, custom partitioning, sparse primary index, secondary data-skipping indexes, etc. In the MergeTree engine, each table consists of multiple \"parts”. A part is created whenever a user inserts data into the table (INSERT statement). A query is always executed against all table parts that exist at the time the query starts.\n\nTo avoid the issue of \"Too many parts\", ClickHouse runs a merge operation in the background which continuously combines multiple (small) parts into a single bigger part. This approach has several advantages: On the one hand, individual inserts are “local” in the sense that they do not need to update global, i.e. per-table data structures. \n\n### Query processing layer\n\nBy using a vectorized query processing layer, Clickhouse can parallelize query execution as much as possible to utilize all resources for maximum speed and efficiency. If you're not aware, “Vectorization” means that query plan operators pass intermediate result rows in batches instead of single rows. This leads to better utilization of CPU caches and allows operators to apply SIMD instructions to process multiple values at once.\n\n## The Speed\n\nThe core aspect of our decision-making process was the overall performance of Clickhouse compared to other data warehouses in the market. \n\n### Clickhouse vs. Redshift\n\nIn 2017, Altinity did a benchmark comparing query performance of denormalized and normalized schemas using NYC taxi trips dataset.\n\n![](https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ch-vs-rs2-i.png)\n\n### Clickhouse vs. Snowflake\n\nSnowflake is at a minimum 3x more expensive than ClickHouse Cloud when projecting costs of a production workload running these [benchmark queries](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-vs-snowflake-for-real-time-analytics-benchmarks-cost-analysis#summary-2). To bring Snowflake to comparable performance to ClickHouse Cloud, Snowflake is 5x more expensive than ClickHouse Cloud for these production workloads.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith all that said, we're super excited to tap into the Clickhouse ecosystem and start building tools and solutions that solve petabyte-scale problems for our stakeholders.
